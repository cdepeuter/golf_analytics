Instructions to get weather files to match with shot-ext files:

Before first run:
From command line run: "Rscript package_installation.R", insure all packages were installed correctly

Necessary files:
Shotlink: in the ./data/shotlink/ directory, the shotlink files for individual tournaments to add need to be there with the filename "shot-ext-tournament-[season]-[course].txt"


Event-course-season:
the full up to date season file needs to be in the ./data/event_course_date/ directory. If a tournament is not in this file it won't be added to the season shotlink file

With these files in the right directory, run "Rscript main_run_weather.R [season]"


Instructions to get weather reports

Before first run:
"install.packages("flexmix")" from within rstudio
create "plots" folder in root directory

"Rscript main_course_weather_report.R  2017 746 <years> <weeks>"

For no previous tournament, to input just date:

"Rscript main_course_weather_report.R 0 0 <years> <weeks> 32.396224139622,-90.094115709412 2016-10-27"

Either of these commands should save 2 plots in /plots/ and the data created to make those plots in /data/historical_weather_[date]_[loc].txt
