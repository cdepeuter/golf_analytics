player drive plots to look at

when I'm looking at just long holes, should I do that just to get regression coeffs or all shots total

am i doing group by dist right? when i look at just long holes after subtracting avg dist for all shots, then i get not great looking coeffs (some positive). Since im looking at the shots on long holes, these shots will be longer.

when i remove avg for ALL shots, mean diff = - 1.8
when i remove long hole shots, mean diff = - 7.8

force intercept 0 ?

What pct of shots do people use non driver


latent mixture models right?

how many classes should latent variable show


Just use all drives to get mean dist and regression features, use all holes othersise
